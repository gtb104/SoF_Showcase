# The Freedom Showcase program website
This site is the Spirit of Freedom marching band's program for the Freedom Showcase.

## Updating data
TBD

## Developing
### Requirements
- Node.js (v24)
- Vercel CLI (v48)

### Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Building
To create a production version of your app: `npm run build`

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`

### Deployment
This may not be necessary because GitHub and Vercel have been linked in the Vercel Dashboard. If this repo is moved to a new maintainer, they will need to re-establish this connection to allow redeployments when code is pushed to GitHub.

1. Log into Vercel: `vercel login`
2. Deploy: `vercel`
