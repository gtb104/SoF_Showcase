# Spirit of Freedom Showcase Program

This is the Spirit of Freedom marching band's program guide.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `css/styles.css`: CSS styles
- `js/main.js`: JavaScript functionality
- `vercel.json`: Vercel deployment configuration

## Local Development

To preview the site locally, you can use any local server. For example:

```bash
npx serve
```

Or simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## Deployment to Vercel

To deploy this site to Vercel:

1. Install Vercel CLI (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from the project directory:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Import your repository or upload your files
4. Deploy!
